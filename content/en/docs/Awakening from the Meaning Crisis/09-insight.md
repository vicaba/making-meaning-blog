## Structure of attention

Attention moves between to axis.

* Explicit and implicit attention axis.
* Features and Gestalt (structural--functional organization) axis.

### Explicit and implicit attention

1. Grab a probe
2. Tap on an object as if we were blind. Try to figure out its shape, weight, density. Use touch because touch is slower than vision. Continue the taping for the next instructions.
3. Tap the object (e.g a cup) until we start to get an image in your mind.
4. Shift your awareness into your probe.
5. Shift the awareness into your fingers.
6. Now, shift your awareness into your probe.
7. Shift your awareness into the object again and feel its shape, weight, etc.

On (3) we are aware throught the probe (subsidiary or *implicit awareness*) of the object, the object is opaque (focal or *explicit awareness*). We can make a transparency to opacity shift.
On (4) we step back. 

Through your fingers (implicit awareness) your are aware of the probe (explicit awareness). We can keep doing it. Back and forth.

* Transparency to opacity shift: we step back from the cup into your mind. 
* Opacity to transparency shift: we step forth from mind into the cup.

When we are *knowing* the cup through the probe, we are in-dwelling the probe, we are *participating* in how the probe is being with respect to the cup.

All the time we were looking at the cup we were looking at it through your feelings, through your fingers, through the probe. So the whole process transparency/opacity is recursive. Wer attention is doing it all the time, flowing in and out.

**We do this flowing in and out not only with technologies but with psycothecnologies also.**

We can move awareness and attention in and out. We can look through a lot of processing deeply out and into the world or we can step back and look at a lot of processig and withrdaw towards the center of your mind.

### Features and Gestalt

Attention is also moving between the features and the structural organization or Gestalt. For example, given a word with missing or unfinished letters, one can *know* the missing letters by putting thei attention to the word (Gestalt), but the word cannot be read unless attention is also put in the features. Attention moves up and down from the Gestalt to the features and vice versa simultaneously.

Nothing is absolutely a feature or the Gestalt. In a single word, the letters are features and the word is the Gestalt. However, in a sentence, the words can be features and the sentence the Gestalt. It is always relative.

### Attention schema

Attention moves dynamically along to axis: explicit/implicit attention and feature/Gestalt attention.

{{< figure class="doc-figure" src="../attention-schema.svg" caption="Attention schema by John Vervaeke">}}

What we usually do is to scale up and down between these two axis. For example, when we scale up, we move from the features to the Gestalt towards an opaque object. Once we get to the Gestalt, we can discover another opaque object, so the Gestalt is now transparent and lets us see the features that constitute the next opaque object, and we can move towards its Gestalt. And this process repeats again and again.

The reverse process, ---scaling down--- is also possible. We move from the Gestalt to the features of what was once transparent. The transparent object becomes opaque and we see that each feature has its own Gestalt. We are moving towards our mind.

## Attention and mindfulness

A system of psychotechnologies that train attention can optimize the capacity for insight.

### Meditation

**Scaling down**. Moving towards the center.
{{% /alert %}}

Normally we don't pay attention to our sensations but through our sensations to the world. Break the Gestalt of our experience into atomic features. Meditation means moving towards the center. To start with meditation, we can pay attention to our breath ---to the sensations of inhaling and exhaling. To keep our attention, we renew interest in the sensations and make them salient.

### Contemplation

## Attention and Insight

There are two moments to having an insight.

### Scaling down

We have to break up the inappropriate frame (break the Gestalt). We also have to deautomatize our cognition. To bring something that happens unconsciously to consciussness. Transparency to opacity shift.

### Scaling up

But then we have to make an alternative and better frame. We have to widen the field of awareness. Take stuff that was in the brakground and change its relevance. I have to look more deeply for deeper and broader patterns.

### Perils and flowing

Both can also make you worse. If we focus on scaling up, we immideately project out our automated pattern. If we only scale down, we chocke ourselves.

We don't want the strings to tight and to loose. We don't want to be in half-way neither. We want to flow between them.
