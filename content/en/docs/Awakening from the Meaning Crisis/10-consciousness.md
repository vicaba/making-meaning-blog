You don't know your consciousness how you know other things. You know your conscousness by being your consciousness. You *participate* in your consciousness.

## What is consciousness? How it emerges out of matter?

## What is the function of consciousness?

### Global Workspace Theory

1. Select pieces of information that are relevant
2. Bring them together
3. Transform them in a way that is relevant
4. Broadcast the changes back

This machinery/structure is trying to solve the "frame problem". It is trying to zero-in relevant information, as the amount of information available in any given scenario is astronomically vast.

* Huge amount of information in the memory and in the present environment
* There are multiple ways to put them together
